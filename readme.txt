== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with third party plugins like Yoast etc.? =

For existing pages/posts, this plugin will take the title from the page as it is created by ANY SEO-plugin, and if you want, you can change it.
And if you have used Yoast-SEO to choose an OG:Image, this plugin will use it as well.

= How do I configure the plugin? =

After installing the plugin, go to the "Branded Social Images" configuration page and set your fallback image, font, -color and -size, add your logo, and you are done.

= How do I add my own fonts? =

To use your own font, you need a .TTF (True Type Font) or .OTF (OpenType Font) file. You can get this from any source you wish, just make sure it is an ordinary font (Google's variable fonts will not work). Upload the font with the "Upload custom font" feature.

= Does the plugin work with international character sets like Kanji (Chinese, Japanese, etc.)? =

Yes, it does, but you have to make sure you upload the appropriate font. If you see "empty square" or "square with a cross" symbols in the image, your font is not compatible.

= Is the plugin MultiSite compatible? =

Yes and no. The plugin can be installed without problems in a MultiSite environment and can be activated per site or network-wide, but the settings are not network-wide.
Although this might be a feature for a future version; there currently is no way to set-up Branded Social Images in one single place for the entire network.

= Is the plugin WPML compatible? =

Yes, as long as your font supports the languages. The supplied fonts are "Western" only. If you need character sets for languages like Korean or Japanese, you need to upload an approriate font.

= Your plugin is not the first I've seen, why bother creating this plugin? =

The plugins we've seen all use an external service to generate the images, or are very complex to use.
We aim for a simple, elegant solution that is completely self-contained.

= Does Branded Social Images use external services? =

For image generation; NO. The plugin is self-contained in that manner.

The plugin does use external services, namely the following, and only once after install or update.
1. Google Fonts - to download a set of sample fonts for you to use (on install or loss of cache folder),
2. Google APIs - to download image conversion software for converting WEBP to PNG so the images can be used by GD2 (on intall and on update).

Number 2 might fail silently, resulting in not being able to use WEBP, but this will in no way affect the plugin itself when using PNG and JPEG.

= I am using plugin XYZ for SEO and your plugin does not use the selected image or configured text, what can I do? =

You can set-up Branded Social Image on every post/page manually, but an automatic solution is always possible.
You can use WordPress filters to influence the text- and image selection process;
1. Filter `bsi_text` with parameters `$text`, `$post_id` and `$image_id`
2. Filter `bsi_image` with parameters `$image_id` and `$post_id`

= I don't like the plugin to live in the main admin menu. =

With WordPress filter `bsi_admin_menu_location` you can move the entry to the Settings menu. Just return any value other than 'main'.

= I want to use a smaller, sidebar version of the post-meta =

Use filter `bsi_meta_box_context` to change the meta-box position, return either `advanced`, `side` or `normal`.
Beware that the `side` option makes the meta-box very small and with that less usable.
In a classic-editor environment, dragging the metabox to the sidebar (or back) is possible.

= Can I assist with translating the plugin? =

Absolutely! A .pot template can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/clearsite/branded-social-images "Branded Social Images on GitHub")
