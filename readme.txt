== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with third party plugins like Yoast etc.? =

This plugin will take the title from the page as it is created by ANY SEO-plugin, and if you want, you can change it. E.g. If you have used Yoast-SEO to choose an OG:Image, this plugin will use it as well.

= How do I configure the plugin? =

After installing the plugin, go to the "Branded social images" configuration page and set your fallback image, font, -color and -size, add your logo, and you are done.

= How do I add my own fonts? =

To use your own font, you need a .TTF (True Type Font) file. You can get this from any source you wish, just make sure it is an ordinary font (Google's variable fonts will not work). Upload the font with the "Upload custom font" feature.
